# Power-tools-Q-Bat-use-case
This repository shows how to model heat transfer in a power toolâ€™s battery pack in Q-Bat from QuickerSim. The model consists 5 Li-ion cells connected in series, terminals, connectors, holders and casing and is connected to a reduced-order model (ROM) to model heat transfer in 3D geometry.
